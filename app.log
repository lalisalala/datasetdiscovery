2024-09-26 13:53:46,149 - streamline - INFO - Final Answer:
Based on the provided dataset, here are the details about the approved meat establishments:

- The data is from the Internal Audit Plan for the years 2015-2016 and can be accessed via this link: [Internal Audit Plan - 2015-2016](https://fsadata.github.io/internal-audit-plan/data/internal-audit-plan-2015-2016.csv).

- The FSA conducted an audit of FBO controls and Animal Welfare Controls, including Slaughter Licences, in August 2011. However, the commitment for annual audits in the first years of a new system focused on specific aspects of the system.

- The Audit of FBO controls was deferred from 2015/16 due to the implementation date of WATOK (Welfare Assurance Trading Scheme) audit, which was deferred from 2015/16 because of legislation implementation delays.

- Incidents Resilience was audited with a focus on whether the Incidents team is learning after practices, linking to corporate risks 3 and 4.

- Animal Health/ Notifiable Diseases were assessed for controls implemented on behalf of Defra / APHA (eg at TB reactor plants) including human health controls, which links to corporate risks 1 and 2.

The dataset does not provide information about the last audit of these establishments or any updates after 2016. Therefore, I am uncertain about the current status of these approvals and audits.

Based on the provided metadata and dataset content, it appears that the document outlines an Internal Audit Plan for the year 2017-18 for the Food Standards Agency (FSA). This plan includes various audits focused on different areas of the agency's operations, including information security, financial assurance, animal by-products, FSA audit of FBO controls, animal welfare controls, incidents resilience, animal health/notifiable diseases, and more.

Each audit has a specific scope and title, such as "Benefits realisation audit following implementation of new meat charging discount system," "Review of open data implementation and application," or "Evolve Programme review." Some audits are follow-up audits to previous years' reports, like the one for Animal By-products, which was last audited in August 2011.

The dataset also includes links to corporate risks associated with each audit, such as risk 6 (Security Risk Management) and risks 1, 2, 3, and 4 in various audits. The purpose of these audits is to ensure that the FSA's systems, controls, and practices comply with relevant guidelines, policies, and legislation, and that they are operating effectively and efficiently.

For example, the "Animal Welfare Controls incl slaughter licences" audit is linked to the WATOK implementation (an animal welfare program) and was deferred from 2015/16 due to legislation implementation date. The "Planning for Brexit" audit will review risk identification, assessment, and mitigation plans.

The audits are scheduled annually or as needed, such as the commitment for an annual audit in the first years of the new system for FSA audit of FBO controls. Some audits focus on specific aspects of a system or program, like the "Campylobacter Programme" audit that will review the effectiveness of business as usual controls following its implementation.

The dataset also includes an external link to the CSV file containing more detailed information about each audit.

Based on the provided information, the internal audit plan for the 2017-18 fiscal year outlines several audits related to various aspects of corporate risk management within the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Here are some examples:

1. **Security Risk Management Return**: Mandatory requirement with an annual review. The independent challenge required here could be evaluating the effectiveness of the processes for recognizing assurance schemes that may be relied on more in future, as suggested by the user's query.

2. **Information Security**: This involves an audit of information security and controls to ensure they comply with Cabinet Office guidelines. The annual audit provides a means to maintain the required level of security.

3. **Financial Assurance**: Audits of financial controls operating centrally and in devolved offices are conducted annually. These audits help ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial data.

4. **Animal By-products**: The assessment of animal by-products official controls at approved meat establishments is linked to corporate risks 1 and 4. The last audit was performed in August 2011, so it would be beneficial to review this scheme for any necessary updates or improvements.

5. **Incidents Resilience**: This audit focuses on whether the Incidents team is learning from past practices. It links to corporate risks 3 and 4, which may involve assessing the agency's ability to respond effectively to crises and improve over time.

6. **Animal Health/ Notifiable Diseases**: Audits are conducted to assess animal health controls implemented on behalf of Defra / APHA, including human health controls. This helps manage risks related to both animal and human health.

The detailed internal audit plan can be found at [this link](https://fsadata.github.io/internal-audit-plan/data/internal-audit-plan-2017-18.csv), which outlines additional audits for the 2017-18 fiscal year. These audits cover areas such as benefits realisation, open data implementation, the Evolve Programme, and more. Each audit is designed to provide assurance that the FSA's controls and systems are functioning effectively in addressing various corporate risks.
