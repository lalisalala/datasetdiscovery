Based on the provided Internal Audit Plan, there are no specific dates mentioned for each audit, however, some of the audits planned in 2017 can be inferred as follows:

1. Animal -by-Products (Further follow-up audit requested by ARAC to review effectiveness of management actions) - No specific date was provided, but it seems this audit is a follow-up, which implies it may have been initiated in a previous year and followed up in 2017.

2. Raw Drinking Milk (Follow up audit to assess effectiveness of management actions implemented to address issues identified.) - Again, no specific date was provided, but it seems this audit is a follow-up, which implies it may have been initiated in a previous year and followed up in 2017.

3. Cutting Establishments Unannounced Inspections (To assess effectiveness of FSA official controls for cutting establishments.) - There's no specific date mentioned, but given that this is a regular audit, it could have been planned for execution in 2017.

4. Local Authority Audits (Complaints about food hygiene/ food premises and infectious disease control-England) - The text mentions "List of internal audits planned by year", but no specific date was provided for this audit. However, as it's a local authority audit, it could have been planned for execution in 2017.

5. Local Authority Audits (Follow-up audits of LAs to check progress in implementing full audit action plans in Wales) - The text suggests that these are follow-up audits, which implies they may have been initiated in a previous year and followed up in 2017.

6. Local Authority Audits (Organisation and Management of Official controls delivered by LAs in Northern Ireland) - As this is a regular audit, it could have been planned for execution in 2017.

7. Local Authority Audits (Audit engagement with all LAs in England achieving less than 90% of planned interventions at premises rated A-E) - The text suggests that this is an ongoing process, but no specific date was provided for this audit. However, as it's a local authority audit, it could have been planned for execution in 2017.

8. Local Authority Audits (Delivery of Animal Feed Law Enforcement Services in Wales) - The text mentions "New model audits will be undertaken across each of the 6 feed regions", which implies these are new audits, and they might have been planned for execution from 2017 onwards.

9. Allergens -England (To assess the adequacy/effectiveness of LA arrangements for the delivery of feed and food law enforcement services in England) - As this is a regular audit, it could have been planned for execution in 2017.

LLM Output:
Based on the information provided, it's not explicitly stated that any specific audits were planned for the year 2017. However, we can infer potential audits from the list of internal audit plans:

1. The Internal Audit Plan for Business Audits could have included the transfer of programme outcomes to business as usual and Planning for Brexit, both of which do not specify a specific year.
2. The Official Controls Audits section includes audits for Campylobacter Programme, Raw Drinking Milk, ABP official controls (follow-up audit), Approved Game Meat Handling Establishments, Slaughterhouse hygiene verification system, and Product Recall system. Again, these do not specify a specific year, so they could have been planned in 2017 or any other year listed.

Therefore, while it's not explicitly stated that audits were planned for 2017, the list of internal audit plans suggests that some or all of these audits could have taken place in 2017 based on the lack of specific year information.

From the context provided, it is not explicitly stated that any specific audits were planned for the year 2017. However, based on the links given for each audit plan, we can infer that some audits could have been scheduled or initiated in 2017 but the reports might have been published later. For instance, the audits related to "Business Audits" (including those for "Transfer of programme outcomes to business as usual", "Planning for Brexit", and "Investment Board"), "Official Controls Audits" (such as the ones for "Campylobacter Programme", "Raw Drinking Milk", "ABP official controls (follow-up audit)", "Approved Game Meat Handling Establishments", "Slaughterhouse hygiene verification system", and "Product Recall system") might have been planned or initiated in 2017. However, it is essential to cross-check the actual dates of the reports on the provided links to confirm this.

Based on the information provided in the context, it appears that the Internal Audit Plan outlines various audits planned by year for both Business Audits and Official Controls Audits. The Business Audits focus on several areas including budget alignments with FSA priorities, transfer of programme outcomes to business as usual, planning for Brexit, work of the Investment Board in prioritising resource allocation, and other miscellaneous topics.

The Official Controls Audits focus on specific programmes or systems such as Campylobacter Programme, Raw Drinking Milk, Approved Game Meat Handling Establishments, Slaughterhouse Hygiene Verification System, and Product Recall system. Each audit has a specific objective, such as reviewing the effectiveness of business-as-usual controls following programme implementation or assessing the effectiveness of FSA controls for RDM on farms where they are directly responsible.

Some audits also provide follow-up information from previous audit reports, such as the ABP official controls (follow-up audit) which aims to assess the effectiveness of management actions taken to address issues identified in a 2016/17 report. Additionally, it seems that the FSA is currently reviewing the efficacy of the product recall system with a view to developing and implementing an improved model.

There's no mention of training and development budgets in this context.

Based on the information provided in the context, it appears that the links provided are for an Internal Audit Plan which outlines various audits planned by year within different categories such as Business Audits and Official Controls Audits. The Business Audits category includes reviews of budgets, transfer of programme outcomes to business as usual, planning for Brexit, work of the Investment Board in prioritising resource allocation, while the Official Controls Audits category includes reviews of various programs like Campylobacter Programme, Raw Drinking Milk, ABP official controls (follow-up audit), Approved Game Meat Handling Establishments, Slaughterhouse hygiene verification system, and Product Recall system.

The audit for Business Audits will review budgets available at corporate, directorate and team level to ensure these are aligned with FSA priorities. For the Science, Evidence and Information programme, the audit will review transfer of programme outcomes to business as usual. For Planning for Brexit, the audit will review risk identification, assessment and mitigation plans. The audit for Investment Board will examine work of the Investment Board in prioritising resource allocation.

In Official Controls Audits, the audit for Campylobacter Programme will review effectiveness of business as usual controls that the FSA is responsible for following implementation of the programme. For Raw Drinking Milk, the audit will assess effectiveness of FSA controls for RDM on farms where the FSA is directly responsible. The audit for ABP official controls (follow-up audit) will assess effectiveness of management actions taken to address issues identified in the report from the original audit in 2016/17.

The audit for Approved Game Meat Handling Establishments will review effectiveness of official controls and follow-up on policy related issues highlighted in previous audit report. The audit for Slaughterhouse hygiene verification system will review effectiveness of the recently introduced system in approved slaughter houses. Lastly, the audit for Product Recall system will review effectiveness of the new product recall model as FSA is currently reviewing efficacy of product recall system with a view to developing and implementing an improved model.

In summary, the Internal Audit Plan includes various audits planned by year under different categories like Business Audits and Official Controls Audits. Each audit aims to ensure alignment with priorities, assess effectiveness of controls, review management actions taken to address issues, examine work in prioritising resource allocation, and review new models and systems being implemented by the FSA.
